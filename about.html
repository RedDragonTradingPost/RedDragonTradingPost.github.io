        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Red Dragon Trading Post, where creativity meets technology in the form of unique, high-quality 3D-printed creations! What started as a hobby has blossomed into a passionate business, born from an accidental discovery that quickly became a love affair with 3D printing. Originally, I bought a resin printer to craft miniatures for my Dungeons & Dragons games, but it wasn’t long before I realized that the possibilities of 3D printing extended far beyond just tabletop gaming. This newfound passion inspired me to start Red Dragon Trading Post, where I could share my creations with others who have similar interests.</p>
	<p>At Red Dragon Trading Post, every product undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets my high standards of quality. I believe in offering only the best—if it’s not something I would personally purchase, it doesn’t make it to the store. Fair pricing is also a priority, as I want my products to be accessible to everyone who shares a love for the things I create.</p>
	<p>But we don’t stop there—if you have a specific vision in mind, we’re here to help. We offer custom 3D model design services and take commissions to ensure you get exactly what you’re looking for. Whether it's a unique item we don’t currently offer or a custom color for something you’ve got your eye on, we’ll work with you to make it happen.</p>
	<p>My offerings cater to fandoms that I am proud to be a part of, with a focus on anime, video games, tabletop gaming, and trading card games. Whether you’re looking for a unique piece to enhance your gaming experience or a collectible that celebrates your favorite characters and stories, you’ll find something special here.</p>
	<p>Looking ahead, I have big dreams for Red Dragon Trading Post. I hope to one day showcase my products at major conventions and events across the United States, bringing my creations directly to the fans who will appreciate them the most. I also aim to make all of my products available online, so anyone, anywhere, can enjoy them. While this business is currently a side hobby, I’m excited to see where this journey takes me—and I’m thrilled to have you along for the ride.</p>
	<p>Stay connected with us on social media to get the latest updates on new products and special offers. Plus, keep an eye out for our upcoming Etsy store, where you’ll be able to shop our full range of 3D-printed creations.</p>
